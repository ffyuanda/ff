# rules:
# 1. set up the boundary to include all possible elements
# 2. after exiting the while loop, left is the minimal kâ€‹ satisfying the
#    condition function

    def condition(value) -> bool:
        pass

    left, right = min(search_space), max(search_space) # could be [0, n], [1, n] etc. Depends on problem
    while left < right:
